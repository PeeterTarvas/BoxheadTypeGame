    So as a warning this project is being developed in another site called Gitlab, but I posted it here so it can be viewd. The main point of the project is to make a copy of an old browser game called Boxhead or atleast the main inspiration for the game is form boxhead (see the youtube link below to see what boxhead looks like). This game is being developed by me and two of my friends. We used Libgdx frameworkd and kryonet library to make the game. To start the game you just have to start the server first(will create server localy on your computer) and then launch the game on client side by starting the game at DesktopLauncher. This project isn't finished yet so the game is quite buggy at times.
